## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to this repository â€” a space dedicated to machine learning projects centered around tabular datasets, with a particular focus on leveraging LightGBM for efficient, high-performance modeling. As a machine learning engineer working at the intersection of structured data and real-world problems, this work reflects a practical approach to building models that are both accurate and scalable.

Most of the projects here involve end-to-end pipelines â€” from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and interpretation. LightGBM is a core tool in this workflow, chosen for its speed, flexibility, and ability to handle large, complex datasets with ease. Whether it's classification, regression, or ranking tasks, the goal is always to deliver models that perform well while maintaining clarity and reproducibility.

This repository features a variety of use cases, ranging from benchmark datasets to more applied problems, such as customer churn prediction, credit scoring, or sales forecasting. Along the way, youâ€™ll find utility scripts, notebooks, and configurations aimed at streamlining experimentation and improving model interpretability, including techniques like SHAP values, feature importance analysis, and cross-validation strategies.

Emphasis is placed on clean, modular code that follows best practices in machine learning engineering â€” version control, pipeline automation, and thoughtful documentation are all part of the process. The aim is not just to build working models, but to develop repeatable systems that others can learn from, adapt, or contribute to.

If youâ€™re interested in tabular ML, feature-rich models, or simply want to explore LightGBM in depth, feel free to browse around, clone a project, or open a discussion. Feedback and collaboration are always welcome.

Thanks for stopping by â€” hope you find something useful or inspiring here.
